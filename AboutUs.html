    <p>
        Jamie's family has grown coffee beans for many years. Jamie, Lei, and Foster made a decision to start a
        coffee business in Atlanta, Ga. After about a year, Chi's Shop was known for their amazing coffee and different flavors.
        This year, 2022, will be our 25 year Anniversary. We started selling Chi's Fav and Nice Touch which
        have gone viral all over TikTok and has brought Chi's Shop over 300 new customers. In 2023, We plan on
        expanding the business to Houston, Texas and Los Angeles, California. We will have two new locations in Georgia
        before the end of 2022.
